Sanic is a Python 3.6+ web server and web framework thatâ€™s written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy.

The goal of the project is to provide a simple way to get up and running a highly performant HTTP server that is easy to build, to expand, and ultimately to scale.  </longdescription>
