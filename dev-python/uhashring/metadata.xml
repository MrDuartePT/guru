uhashring implements consistent hashing in pure Python.

Consistent hashing is mostly used on distributed systems/caches/databases as this avoid the total reshuffling of your key-node mappings when adding or removing a node in your ring (called continuum on libketama). More information and details about this can be found in the literature section.

This full featured implementation offers:

a lot of convenient methods to use your consistent hash ring in real world applications.
simple integration with other libs such as memcache through monkey patching.
a full ketama compatibility if you need to use it (see important mention below).
all the missing functions in the libketama C python binding (which is not even available on pypi) for ketama users.
possibility to use your own weight and hash functions if you don't care about the ketama compatibility.
instance-oriented usage so you can use your consistent hash ring object directly in your code (see advanced usage).
native pypy support, since this is a pure python library.
tests of implementation, key distribution and ketama compatibility.
Per node weight is also supported and will affect the nodes distribution on the ring.
