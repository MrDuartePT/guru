Module for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.

    Note: From version 2.0.1 the namespace has changed from jwt to python_jwt, in order to avoid conflict with PyJWT.
    Note: Versions 1.0.0 and later fix a vulnerability in JSON Web Token verification so please upgrade if you're using this functionality. The API has changed so you will need to update your application. verify_jwt now requires you to specify which signature algorithms are allowed.
    Uses jwcrypto to do the heavy lifting.
    Supports RS256, RS384, RS512, PS256, PS384, PS512, HS256, HS384, HS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, ES256K, EdDSA and none signature algorithms.
    Unit tests, including tests for interoperability with jose.
    Supports Python 2,7 and 3.6+. Note: generate_jwt returns the token as a Unicode string, even on Python 2.7.
