A python package that works to provide a nice set of testing utilities for the kazoo library.

It includes the following functionality:

    Storage access (for viewing what was saved/created).
    Kazoo mostly compatible client API.
    Sync/transaction/create/get/delete... commands.
    Listener support.
    And more...

It simplifies testing by providing a client that has a similar API as the kazoo client so that your tests (or applications/libraries that use kazoo) do not require a real zookeeper server to be tested with (since this is not available in all testing environments).
