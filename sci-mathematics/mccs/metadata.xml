mccs (which stands for Multi Criteria CUDF Solver) is a CUDF problem solver developed at UNS during the European MANCOOSI project. mccs take as input a CUDF problem and computes the best solution according to a set of criteria. It relies on a Integer Programming solver or a Pseudo Boolean solver to achieve its task. mccs can use a wide set of underlying solvers like Cplex, Gurobi, Lpsolver, Glpk, CbC, SCIP or WBO.
