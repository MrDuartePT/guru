    No authentication. No API. No limits.

Twint is an advanced Twitter scraping tool written in Python that allows for scraping Tweets from Twitter profiles without using Twitter's API.

Twint utilizes Twitter's search operators to let you scrape Tweets from specific users, scrape Tweets relating to certain topics, hashtags &amp; trends, or sort out sensitive information from Tweets like e-mail and phone numbers. I find this very useful, and you can get really creative with it too.

Twint also makes special queries to Twitter allowing you to also scrape a Twitter user's followers, Tweets a user has liked, and who they follow without any authentication, API, Selenium, or browser emulation.
tl;dr Benefits

Some of the benefits of using Twint vs Twitter API:

    Can fetch almost all Tweets (Twitter API limits to last 3200 Tweets only);
    Fast initial setup;
    Can be used anonymously and without Twitter sign up;
    No rate limitations.

Limits imposed by Twitter

Twitter limits scrolls while browsing the user timeline. This means that with .Profile or with .Favorites you will be able to get ~3200 tweets.
